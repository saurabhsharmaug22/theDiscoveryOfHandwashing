DataCamp Project : Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.

In this python project we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected. This project assumes that you are familiar with python and pandas DataFrames. You can learn the required skills: Data Manipulation with pandas, Data Visualization with matplotlib
